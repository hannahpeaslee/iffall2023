            <li>Hannah Peaslee, ComDes and Psych major, Junior.</li>
            <li>I recently switched from ArtSci to Sam Fox to major in ComDes. I'm really interested in UIUX design, so I figured taking this class would be helpful for that.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no experience with HTML, CSS, or JS.</li>
            <li>Honestly I just hope to learn enough about HTML/CSS to be able to feel comfortable making something that is slightly more than bare-bones.</li>
            <li>I think the biggest difference in designing for screen is the added capabilities it offers - you can create links and connections, have a responsive design, etc.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube website</a> <br>I think the youtube website just overall has an effective design. It's easy to understand, and the organization and layout make it really easy to use. The sidebar has been designed well, and the layout of the page when you watch a video has implemented all the different features quite well.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood website</a> <br>This website effectively communicates its purpose, but also makes it clear what you can do on the website and how to do it. The clean layout and module-y design helps that.</li>
            <li><a href="https://zbib.org/">ZoteroBib website</a> <br>I think part of why this website works so well is its simplicity. It does what it needs to do and nothing more. It allows you to generate citations and a bibliography, and also allows you to change citation style afterwards and it will apply to all the citations you've already generated.</li>
