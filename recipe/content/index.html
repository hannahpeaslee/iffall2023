                <h3>Thai-style Stir-fried Noodles with Chicken and Broccolini <a href="https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/7029-thai-style-stir-fried-noodles-with-chicken-and-broccolini">(from Cook's Illustrated)</a></h3>
                <h3>Serves 4, time: 1.5 hours</h3>
                <h3>Common allergens: egg, garlic, gluten</h3>
                <h3>This Thai-Style Stir-Fried Noodle recipe is a definite keeper, producing restaurant quality (or better!) noodles in the home kitchen. The chicken stays phenomenally moist and flavorful, the broccolini cut into bite-sized pieces adds crunch, and the rice noodles soak up all the wonderful flavors of the sauce.</h3>

                    <h4>Serve straight out of the pan or transfer to a large heat-safe bowl.</h4>
                    <h4>Leftovers can be kept in the fridge for a few days.</h4>

                    <h4>Tips and Notes</h4>
                    The most important thing with this recipe or any stir-fry recipe is to NOT STIR. It seems counter-intuitive, but to develop a nice sear in the noodles, chicken, and vegetables, it's necessary to leave the food alone while it's in the skillet. Otherwise the food will steam instead of brown.
                    <br>Giving the chicken a soak in a baking powder/water solution before cooking raises its pH and prevents the chickens' proteins from bonding together tightly which enables you to leave it in the pan longer without the risk of it becoming dry and chewy.

                <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
                <a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-vegan-tuna-melt/">The Minimalist Baker</a> <br> I think the design of this website is super helpful for your first time making a recipe - the step-by-step instructions with pictures make it feel like I'm being guided through the recipe. However, I feel like this is less ideal if you've made the recipe before and just need it as a reference; because of how all the steps are so spread out, it's not easy to get the gist of the recipe if you don't want to read all the words.
                <br><a href="https://damndelicious.net/2022/08/12/the-best-ever-cheeseburger/">Damn Delicious</a> <br>I like the option to skip the intro and go straight into the recipe, which is seperated into a recipe card style section. They put important info at the top of the recipe card (how many servings it makes, how long it takes to make), as well as options to print or pin the actual recipe. The instructions and ingredients are easy to read, with the steps outlined with number icons and certain important words bolded.
                <br><a href="https://therecipecritic.com/quick-45-minute-cinnamon-rolls/">The Recipe Critic</a> <br> I like how the ingredients and instructions are seperated into different parts of the dish (there's a section for dough, one for filling, and another for glaze), so you know what's being used for what and can kind of segment things up. I also like how each step in the instructions has a phrase at the start that sums up what you're doing in the step and then follows that with more detailed instructions - I think it makes the recipe easier to read and follow. The tips and faq sections at the bottom are a good idea.
                <h2>Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
                <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Parallel-Park">Wikihow</a> <br> The section at the top of things you should know is super helpful because it gives an overview of the whole process to give you an idea of what you're doing before you actually dive in. I think the way they organized the steps establishes a really clear hierarchy - they use icons, color, scale, text weight, and bullet points for extra information within a step. I like having the step title and detailed instructions seperated by an image as well.
                <br><a href="https://spotify.design/article/ask-spotify-design-07">Spotify Design</a> <br> I was surprised by how the large margins on either side of the text block made it so much easier to read the content on these pages. The text only spans about a third of the page width, while on other sites I looked at the line lengths were much longer and therefore harder to read. Also the way they treated text on these pages really eases the reading process - the font selection and paragraph/line spacing feels perfect, and I don't feel overwhelmed trying to read longer paragraphs.
                <br><a href="https://www.howacarworks.com/brakes/checking-and-renewing-brake-cables">How A Car Works</a> <br> Putting imagery to the side was smart on this website, that way they can still include large images without having them take up the entire viewable space of the page. I really like the decision to have unfamiliar terms highlighted, where you are able to hover over them to bring up a definition and some basic info - I think this could be a way to include tips without clogging up the page. However, the way they layed out their text is very overwhelming; there's long sections that have no variation, and the line length is too long to make for easy reading.
