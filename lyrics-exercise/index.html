                            <p><strong>About:</strong> “Levanter” expresses the need to move on and accept reality away from the anticipation of a perfect state. 
                                It's about letting go of something but with hope and possibility, and with the awareness that the path is ultimately theirs to define.</p>

            <p class="lyrics">
                Never wanted anything as much as you <br>
                Never crossed my mind that I could ever lose <br>
                I had this picture in my head <br>
                Of all the promises you made <br>   
            </p>
            <p class="lyrics">
                But you turned 'em into dust <br>
                Empty handed now I'm lost <br>
                I know I gotta let go <br>
                With no regrets you're already gone
            </p>
            <p class="lyrics">
                I let my dreams tie me down <br>
                (Oh) Is it too late can I break out? <br>
                (Oh) They say it's darkest of all before the dawn
            </p>
            <p class="lyrics">
                I wanna be myself (I don't care) <br>
                Yeah, I gotta be myself (just don't care) <br>
                And now that your weight's come off my shoulders <br>
                I realize that I can fly <br>
                I needed to find me (now I know) <br>
                The key was inside of me all along <br>
                I'm listening to my heart, let it guide me <br>
                I feel the light, I feel the light
            </p>
            <p class="lyrics">
                I never stopped <br>
                (To find my way) <br>
                I always thought (it was a race) <br>
                To win it all and that you were the prize
            </p>
            <p class="lyrics">
                The closer I got the more I lost <br>
                My soul, it was slowly fading <br>
                I'm like the autumn leaves, don't know which way I'm blowing <br>
                But it don't matter if it's raining or it's snowing <br>
                All of my problems growing smaller when I'm way up here <br>
                Any illusions I had left about you disappeared
            </p>
            <p class="lyrics">
                This is the end of the road <br>
                (Oh) I'm holding out for a new hope <br>
                (Oh) 'Cause it's the darkest of all before the dawn
            </p>
            <p class="lyrics">
                I wanna be myself (I don't care) <br>
                Yeah, I gotta be myself (just don't care) <br>
                And now that your weight's come off my shoulders <br>
                I realize that I can fly <br>
                I needed to find me (now I know) <br>
                The key was inside of me all along <br>
                I'm listening to my heart, let it guide me <br>
                I feel the light, I feel the light
            </p>
            <p class="lyrics">
                Afraid to let you go, but in my heart I know <br>
                Got to move on <br>
                I think it's time <br>
                It's all good now
            </p>
            <p class="lyrics">
                I wanna be myself (I don't care) <br>
                Yeah, I gotta be myself (just don't care) <br>
                And now that I left it all behind me <br>
                I'm flying high, I'm flying high
            </p>
